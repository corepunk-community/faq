## Character Creation

### Can I change heroes after I create my character?

No, but you can create alts, and in the future you will be able to swap between three different sub-classes for each hero. 

### Can I change my appearance or gender?

No, but you can get skins.

## Questing

### How do I figure out a quest I’m having trouble with?

First, press J and read over the quest again, review the conversation, and see if that helps. If not, you have a few options:

1. Look on [Corepunkers: Quests](https://corepunkers.com/quests) to see if the information you need is there
2. Look on [Corepunkers: NPCs](https://corepunkers.com/npcs) to see if the information you need is there. 
3. Search the Official and Community discords
4. Ask in the Official and/or Community discords
5. Ask in game chat, friendly people may pin the location or help out

### Do I need to do all of the quests immediately?

No, Corepunk is a bit different in this regard. You can skip quests that are out of your way or you don't have the resources to complete, and come back to them later. In Alpha 3, you didn't even need to do the main story quest at all. That may have changed for Alpha 4 though if there is a mount quest that has pre-requisites. 

### Where can I find this NPC? 

Check out [Corepunkers: NPCs](https://corepunkers.com/npcs) or ask in-game or in Discord.

### What else can I do other than questing and harvesting?

* Open world PvP
* PvE in PvE zones
* PvE in PvP zones
* World bosses
* Chest farming
* Random chest hunting
* Crafting
* Theorycrafting
* Duels
* Scrims

### Where is Zugg’s brother?

Which one? 

### Where are pipes and whiskey?

They are both random drops from interactables (cupboards, barrels, stoves, etc) and drop more in less busy areas.

### How do I get heartwood?

Chopping down Timberheart trees.

### Where is Big Mama?

In Goldenfield, near the cafe and the primary kitchen/fire. 

### The game feels so slow, how do I increase my movement speed?

* Support Talent Tree
* Hunter Talent Tree
* Dark Horse Rune (max 1)
* Mount (around level 15)
* Food (Pasta "Bloodonjeze")
* Potentially Hero abilities or weapon specializations

## Combat and Recovery

### I’m running out of health and mana frequently, how do I recover more quickly?

* Campfires
* Public Campfires
* Food
* Talents (Pathfinder, Mage)
* Short Consumes (Painkillers, Mana Vial)
* Long Consumes (Ointments, Mana Pipe)

### How do I make campfires? 

Press Y and craft with 3x wood and 1x matchess. If you are crafting in bulk, consider swapping to Pathfinder Talents to reduce the cost to 2x wood instead.

### Where can I find free campfires?

[Corepunkers: Map](https://map.corepunkers.com/)

### How do I get rid of respawn sickness?

Wait about five minutes.

### What is a resurrection stone/herokit?

These are items that allow you to immediately resurrect on the spot, at the cost of one stone.

## Grouping

### How do I group with friends? 

Type `/invite FriendName`. 

### What is the max group size? 

Four.

### My friend has a quest that I can’t pick up, what gives?

It's likely part of a chain, has a pre-requisite, or you already did the quest. 

### How does group XP work?

XP is split between members of the group, so it is relatively expensive to carry people. 

### How does group loot work?

It seems to work differently for bosses/mob drops and chests. 

For bosses/mob drops in Alpha 3 there was some sort of contribution formula that probably had a relatively short window and only included damage done, so healers often didn't often get loot. 

For most or all chests, drops are provided per person in the group and there is a very long range so even if you aren't nearby you can often still get loot.

### How do I trade?

Click on the player, click their bar at the top of the screen, and click Exchange. 

`/trade Playername` may also work. 

### How do I auto-run / follow? 

Press Z to auto run.

To follow: click on a player, click the bar at the top of the screen, click Follow. Choo choo, train to the PvP zone departing now. 

### Why can't I see my friend if we're at the same place in-game?

You are probably on separate layers. Try inviting them to a group, this will usually put you on the same layer. 

## Game Concepts

### What are layers?

Layers are like shards or channels that you can't directly control (though some actions are likely to cause you to change layers, for example joining a group). 

They provide ability to be able to scale up and down a single regional server based on player population. 

## Builds

### What are Weapon Specializations?

Weapon specializations are a progression path that is specific to each sub-class and offers significant buffs, changes, or even replacement abilities. They are designed to force you to make hard choices, and require a considerable amount of play time to cap. 

You level up weapon specializations using catalysts which are looted from mobs and chests. 

[Corepunk: Weapon Specializations](https://corepunk.com/en/news/article/61)

### What are Talents?

Talents are another progression path but are passives and not specific to a sub-class. You get your first Talent tree at level 6, your second at level 10, and your third at level 20. 

[Corepunk: Passive Talents](https://corepunk.com/en/news/article/60)

[Corepunkers: Talent Calculator](https://corepunkers.com/talent-calculator)

### Can we easily change Talents and Weapon Specializations?

Yes, the items required had a relatively high drop rate in Alpha 3 and at least Talent Renewal Cubes were able to be purchased from a vendor for about 25 gold. 

### What are Universal Abilities?

You can choose two universal abilities, which are sort of like Summoner Spell's in League of Legends. 

You can purchase them in the war camp to the west of Goldenfield, and you can get your first one around level 5 and your second around level 10. 

### How do I use runes?

Right-click on a rune, then right-click on your artifact.

### How many runes can I use?

Two, but only one of them can be Dark Horse (movement speed). 

### How do I use chips?

1. Press Ctrl + RMB on your weapon to open the Chip window. 
2. Click the chip in your inventory
3. Click the empty slot on your weapon
4. If they match, the chip will be inserted

## Gear & Crafting

### How do I get better gear? 

You can buy it, craft it, or loot it from PvE and chests. 

### Where can I buy my first weapon?

[Ratchet](https://corepunkers.com/npcs/ratchet) no longer sells weapons and only sells random recipes, so the getting your first weapon is more challenging than it was in Alpha 3. 

* Check all vendors for weapons and weapon recipes
* wolves, use a group if you need to. Craft Assault Launcher for Ratchet and the reward is a weapon, not all are decent
* Skeletons
* Chests in the PvP zone

### Where can I buy my first artifacts?

[Griz Turner](https://corepunkers.com/npcs/griz-turner)

### Where can I buy level 10 weapons and recipes? 

Near [Razz Thundermaw](https://corepunkers.com/npcs/razz-thundermaw), there are vendors for each class. 

The Main Story Quest offers a Level 10 Rare weapon, but the alternative choices are rare artifacts

### How do I earn gold?

* Harvest
* Craft at 100%
* Kill skeletons
* Chests

## Harvesting

### How do I harvest specific items?

## PvP

### Is there PvP?

Yes. You could theoretically play the game without engaging in PvP, but you would be pretty limited in what you could accomplish.

### How do I flag for PvP?

The flagging mechanics in Corepunk after different from most games. You can press 'P' to toggle between Combat mode and Peaceful mode. 

In Combat mode you can do damage to other players, which may result in... consequences. 

### What are the consequences of PvP?

There are three types of zones in Corepunk: **Safe Zone, Protected Zone, Battleground Zone**

In **Protected Zones** you drop one stack of resources.

In **Battleground Zones** you drop five stacks of items, which can include anything that is unbound: resources, consumes, campfires, and most importantly, weapons, artifacts, runes, and chips that you have not yet extracted from the PvP zone. This is where the juicy PvP loot is.

Safe Zone: 

* No Honor granted for PvP activity 
* Aggressor loses 500 karma for each PvP killing 
* Drop 1 random resource from inventory when killed 
* Criminal status granted at 1000 Karma

* Killing a mob grants a small amount of karma 
* Chests contain skins, gold, recipes, and consumables 
* Teleporting permitted everywhere
